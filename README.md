# Task 5: Traffic Accident Data Analysis

This project is part of my internship at **Prodigy Infotech (June 2025)** in the Data Science domain.

### 📌 Objective:
To analyze traffic accident data and identify patterns based on:
- Road conditions
- Weather
- Time of day

Also visualized accident hotspots and contributing factors using data visualization techniques.

### 🛠️ Tools & Libraries:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Plotly (optional for interactive visualizations)

---

### 🔎 Key Steps:
1. Loaded and cleaned accident dataset
2. Performed EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
3. Visualized:
   - Accidents by time of day
   - Accidents by weather and road condition
   - Heatmaps for accident hotspots
4. Found correlations between different factors contributing to accidents

---

### ✅ Insights:
- Most accidents occurred during peak traffic hours
- Poor road and weather conditions significantly increased accident probability
- Hotspot locations identified can help in preventive measures
